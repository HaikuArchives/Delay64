Delay64 V0.00 - The incredibly slow and non working N64 emulator
Copyright (C) 1999 Tinic Uro <turo@beatware.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is the result of 4 days of coding. Don't expect 
anything to work. In fact I did this small project only 
to get some knowledge about the MIPS architecure and the 
N64 hardware.

I actually developed this one on BeOS R4 Intel, therefore I 
use mainly the BeOS API for the debugger and the output, which
simplified the development dramatically.

Future plans? First I need to fix remaining problems in
the main cpu opcodes, exceptions/interrupts, then I 
will start to implement most of the rsp opcodes.

Actually there is only one rom showing something on the 
screen: the fire demo. And even this one shows a (or more) 
bug(s) in the opcodes.

If someone is interested to participate enhancing this
emulator write me a mail. I also need more info on the hardware
of the N64 and the detailed behaviors. All the information
I have is from www.dextrose.com, a really good source, 
and naturally the TrueReality sourcecode. But its really 
not enough. I had a N64 some time ago, but got rid of it 
since I went from Europe to the Unites States for some 
time. PAL machines don't work really well there...
